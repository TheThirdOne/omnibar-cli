omnibar-cli
===========

A library for making functional omnibar commands in chrome extensions.

Why
---

What is the biggest lack of chrome? A cli. This allows developers to fill in missing applications like wget. The number of options for wget and similar applications is staggering; as a result, a cli is really the best option. But text boxes? The omnibar is really the obivious solution because of its connection to chrome apps and built in tab completion.
